ColorSchemes
============

CPSLegacy is for Xcode

Place the color scheme file into:
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes

You will have to create this directory if it doesn't yet exist.

Restart Xcode if it is running.
Then select the color scheme file inside Xcode by choosing
Xcode->Preferences->Fonts and Colors.

The scheme should appear in the left sidebar as CPSLegacy.

For best results, install DejaVu Sans Mono fonts.

=======================================

SolarizedCPS.tmTheme is for TextMate and also for Sublime.
Place in
"/home/<username>/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/Color Scheme - Default"
